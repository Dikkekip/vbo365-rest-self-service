## About
This serves as an example on how to work with the RESTful API calls and shouldn't be used in production. Feel free to modify and re-use it however many calls are done with default values which can be modified if needed.

## Known issues
* When performing item restore via the full admin view it is required to terminate the session via the button 'End item restore' or the session will keep running in the background.

**Note:** There is currently no SSL verification due to self signed certificate testing, please change settings 'verify' to true or remove the specific line accordingly in `veeam.class.php`.
